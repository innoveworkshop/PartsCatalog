# PartsCatalog Database Template

Here's a little template to allow you to run PartsCatalog on your own machine.
All you have to do is to open this folder from within the application and start
adding data to it.


## First Steps

After you open this database up for the first time on the application, please
start by creating some categories, sub-categories, and packages using the
managers inside the program, then start adding your components.


## Folder Structure

For the program to work properly you need to have the following folder structure
which will be used by the application to store the database and all of its
related assets.

  - Workspace Root/
    - Datasheets/
	- Images/
	- Your Database.mdb
